Hi, welcome to **SplitWise**, a web app that allows you to split bills between friends

# About the repo:

The repo at the moment only contains a front-end app built using vanila React and Material UI.

The repo tries to follow monorepo structure. Most of the code will be in `src/` and other configurations or Docker-related stuff will be in the root folder.

# Features and roadmap (to be added)
